#  UDP Audio Communication Project

This project is a UDP audio communication application developed using Java and Python programming languages. This application can be used to communicate audio between two computers.


## Java Usage

 1. First, you need two computers with Java installed.
 2. Make sure that the computers are on the same network.
 3. Download the source code of the project to both computers.
 4. Run [Reciever.java](https://github.com/ahmettopak/UdpAudio/blob/main/src/Receiver.java) file first.
 5. Then, run [Sender.java](https://github.com/ahmettopak/UdpAudio/blob/main/src/Sender.java) file.
 6. The communication between the two computers will start
    automatically.
## Python Usage

. First, you need two computers with Java installed.
 2. Make sure that the computers are on the same network.
 3. Download the source code of the project to both computers.
 4. Run [reciever.py](https://github.com/ahmettopak/UdpAudio/blob/main/receiver.py) file first.
 5. Then, run  [sender.py](https://github.com/ahmettopak/UdpAudio/blob/main/sender.py) file.
 6. The communication between the two computers will start
    automatically.
## Principles

This project allows data to be transmitted at high speed using the UDP protocol. This protocol allows data to be transmitted in packets and is faster, although less reliable. Additionally, the project uses pyaudio, a special library for processing audio data.

## Limitations

This project is designed only for communication between two computers. Also, the quality of the audio may vary depending on the network connection.
